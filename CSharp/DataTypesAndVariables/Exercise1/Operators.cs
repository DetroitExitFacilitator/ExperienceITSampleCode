            += -= *= /= %= are different types of mathematical operators.So, addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/) and the Modulo operator(%).

            Now, the "=" also plays a part in these operations. For example, consider the addition operator(+=).The '+' will actually perform the addtion while the '=' will assign that value to the variable.

            So, if we declare that X = 5 then 'X += 2' will set the value of X as 7.The '+' adds 2 to 5 and the '=' assigns the value 7 to the variable X.

            //Write a program that declares a variable with an initial value of 9.

            //Now use the addition operator to add the variable with itself

            //use that same variable again and subtract 2 from itself using the subtraction operator

            //use the multiplication operator to multiply the integer by 8

            //use the division operator to divide the integer by 3

            //use the modulus operator to mod the integer by 10
