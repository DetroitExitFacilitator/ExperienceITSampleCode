            += -= *= /= %= are different types of mathematical operators. So, addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/) and the Modulo operator(%).
            
            Note: These operators are just used as a shorthand.  For example, value = value + 5, can be written as value += 5.

            Now, the "=" also plays a part in these operations. For example, consider the addition operator(+=).The '+' will actually perform the addtion while the '=' will assign that value to the variable.

            So, if we declare that X = 5 then 'X += 2' will set the value of X as 7.The '+' adds 2 to 5 and the '=' assigns the value 7 to the variable X.

            //Have that integer use the addition operator to add itself with itself

            //Use that integer again and subtract 2 from itself using the subtraction operator

            //Use the multiplication operator to multiply the integer by 8

            //Use the division operator to divide the integer by 3

            //Use the modulus operator to mod the integer by 10
